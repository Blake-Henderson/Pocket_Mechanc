Known bugs:
app dies if you hot reload
weird formatting on most buttons/labels
no idea what happens if you go offline
error texts on login page do not appear
there are no error texts on any other page
first thing of gas added always shows up as 0.0mpg this is intentional since I have no way of knowing previous gas mileage
gas screen also just grabs DateTime.now since it is meant to be used the moment you put in the gas
same for the parts screen
App is generally ugly
